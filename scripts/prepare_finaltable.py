Combined step 1 + 2: trim redundant/collinear features, then apply the
agreed missingness strategy, producing a fully complete (no-NaN) table
ready for the One-Class SVM.

=== STEP 1: trim redundant/collinear features ===
Only TRUE duplicates are dropped -- columns that are different
representations of the exact same underlying signal (r >= ~0.99, per
eda_correlation.py), not columns that are merely correlated but
conceptually distinct.

Groups collapsed, and which column was kept:
  - total_poe_hand_washing / passed / sanitised / screened (all r=1.0)
    -> kept total_poe_screened
  - total_poe_refused_hand_washing / refused_screening (r=1.0)
    -> kept total_poe_refused_screening
  - flowminder_short_trips__outflow_20260430/0507/0514/0521/0524
    (all r>=0.99 -- 5 dated snapshots of the same signal)
    -> kept the most recent, outflow_20260524
  - flowminder_short_trips__ituri_subscriber_days_prior/followup (r=0.998)
    -> kept followup (more recent)
  - flowminder_short_trips__nk_subscriber_days_prior/followup (r=0.994)
    -> kept followup (more recent)
Also drops the national_* leftover columns (structurally always-missing
in a zone-level table -- national totals only ever appeared on rows
already split into insp_sitrep_national_clean.csv).

=== STEP 2: missingness strategy ===
  1. Drop columns >70% missing -- too sparse to trust or usefully impute.
  2. Forward-fill cumulative_* columns per zone, ordered by date --
     matches INSP's own documented convention (carry the previous
     cumulative value forward when a day is ND).
  3. Drop rows where the target (new_suspected_cases) is missing -- the
     single biggest cut (218 -> 94 rows in testing). Cannot train on a
     missing target regardless of imputation strategy.
  4. Drop new_contacts_listed, cumulative_contacts_traced (secondary
     operational metrics) and cumulative_confirmed_deaths,
     new_suspected_deaths (tested dropping these columns vs. their rows
     -- dropping columns preserves 79 rows vs. 63; deaths aren't part of
     the core anomaly-detection signal and CFR is already covered
     separately by plot_insight_charts.py using the full-range file).
  5. Impute remaining Flowminder missingness with 0 -- defensible here
     specifically because missingness means "no measurable mobile-
     subscriber signal" (low cell-tower coverage zones).
  6. Drop any remaining rows with leftover NaN -- small final cleanup.
